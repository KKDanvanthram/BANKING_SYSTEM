# BANKING_SYSTEM
This C++ program features a basic banking system using a `Bank` class. Users can add accounts, check balances, deposit, and withdraw funds. Account details, including number, holder name, and balance, are stored in vectors. The program emphasizes simplicity and fundamental banking operations.This C++ program is designed to simulate a straightforward banking system through a class named Bank. Users can execute essential banking tasks, including adding accounts, checking balances, depositing, and withdrawing money. The class utilizes three distinct vectors to store crucial account details: account number, account holder name, and balance. The simplicity of the program's structure facilitates user interaction with common financial operations.
